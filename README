DESCRIPTION:
  Re-sources a VIM script. The script may use a multiple inclusion guard
  variable g:loaded_{scriptname} (with {scriptname} having either the same
  case as specified or all lowercase.) 
  If you specify the bare scriptname (without .vim extension), the script must
  reside in $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/{scriptname}.vim. Otherwise, the passed
  filespec is interpreted as the file system location of a VIM script and
  sourced as-is. 
  If you execute :ReloadScript without passing a scriptname, the current
  buffer is re-sourced. 

USAGE:
  :ReloadScript Re-sources the current buffer. 
  :ReloadScript {scriptname} Re-sources the passed plugin script. 
  :ReloadScript {path/to/script.vim} Re-sources the passed file. 

ASSUMPTIONS:
  Not every script supports reloading. There may be error messages like
  "function already exists". To support reloading, the script should use the
  bang (!) variants of :function! and :command!, which will automatically
  override already existing elements. 

  Ensure that the script uses a multiple inclusion guard variable that
  conforms to the conventions mentioned above. The :ReloadScript command will
  issue a warning if it cannot find the inclusion guard variable.
