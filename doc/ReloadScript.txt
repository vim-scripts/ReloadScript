DESCRIPTION					    *ReloadScript-description*

Re-sources a Vim script. The script may use a multiple inclusion guard
variable g:loaded_{scriptname} (with {scriptname} having either the same case
as specified or all lowercase.)
If you specify the bare scriptname (without .vim extension), the script must
reside in $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/{scriptname}.vim. Otherwise, the passed filespec
is interpreted as the file system location of a Vim script and sourced as-is.
If you execute :ReloadScript without passing a scriptname, the current buffer
is re-sourced.

RELATED WORKS								     *

==============================================================================
USAGE							  *ReloadScript-usage*
							       *:ReloadScript*
ReloadScript				Re-sources the current buffer.
ReloadScript {scriptname}		Re-sources the passed plugin script.
ReloadScript {path/to/script.vim}	Re-sources the passed file.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					   *ReloadScript-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim ReloadScript*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					   *ReloadScript-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS					    *ReloadScript-limitations*

- The script cannot reload itself :-)

ASSUMPTIONS					    *ReloadScript-assumptions*

Not every script supports reloading. There may be error messages like
"function already exists". To support reloading, the script should use the
bang (!) variants of :function! and :command!, which will automatically
override already existing elements.

Ensure that the script uses a multiple inclusion guard variable that conforms
to the conventions mentioned above. The :ReloadScript command will issue a
warning if it cannot find the inclusion guard variable.

KNOWN PROBLEMS					 *ReloadScript-known-problems*

TODO							   *ReloadScript-todo*

IDEAS							  *ReloadScript-ideas*

- For compiler, ftplugin, indent and syntax scripts, find all buffers that
  have the script sourced and re-source in that buffer. Currently, one must
  manually :e! these buffers.

HISTORY							*ReloadScript-history*

1.21	27-Aug-2012
- Avoid <f-args> because of its unescaping behavior.
- Also no global inclusion guard for ftdetect scripts.

1.20	07-Jan-2011
- BUG: Avoiding "E471: Argument required" error on empty buffer name.
- ENH: Explicitly checking for the existence of the file, as we don't want to
  put the :source command inside try...catch (it would stop showing all
  resulting errors and show only the first), and because :runtime doesn't
  complain at all.
- Added separate help file and packaging the plugin as a vimball.

1.10	25-Jul-2008
Combined missing inclusion guard warning with reload message to avoid the "Hit
ENTER" prompt. No missing inclusion guard warning for scripts that do not need
one (e.g. after-directory, autoload, ftplugin, indent, syntax, ...)

1.10	28-Feb-2008
A scriptname argument with path and/or extension is sourced as-is. This allows
a third usage: :ReloadScript {path/to/script.vim}

1.00	22-May-2007
First published version.

0.01	14-Dec-2006
Started development.
