" ReloadScript.vim: Reload a VIM script during script development. 
"
" DESCRIPTION:
"   Re-sources a VIM script. The script may use a multiple inclusion guard
"   variable g:loaded_<scriptname> (with <scriptname> having either the same
"   case as specified or all lowercase.) 
"   If you specify the scriptname (without .vim extension), the script must
"   reside in $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/<scriptname>.vim. If you execute :ReloadScript
"   without passing a scriptname, the current buffer is re-sourced. 
"
" USAGE:
"   :ReloadScript		Re-sources the current buffer. 
"   :ReloadScript <scriptname>	Re-sources the passed plugin script. 
"
" INSTALLATION:
"   Put the script into your user or system VIM plugin directory (e.g.
"   ~/.vim/plugin). 
"
" DEPENDENCIES:
"   - Requires VIM 7.0 or higher. 
"
" CONFIGURATION:
"
" LIMITATIONS:
"   - The script cannot reload itself :-)
"
" ASSUMPTIONS:
"   Not every script supports reloading. There may be error messages like
"   "function already exists". To support reloading, the script should use the
"   bang (!) variants of :function! and :command!, which will automatically
"   override already existing elements. 
"
"   Ensure that the script uses a multiple inclusion guard variable that
"   conforms to the conventions mentioned above. The :ReloadScript command will
"   issue a warning if it cannot find the inclusion guard variable.
